This project demonstrates a cloud-native data pipeline using the MovieLens 32M dataset. It ingests data into Google Cloud Storage, processes it in BigQuery with a star schema, and applies NLP for sentiment analysis on movie tags. The fully automated pipeline is visualized in Looker Studio for insights at scale.
